But the next morning, He angrily accused me of drugging him and stormed out without looking back. \n \nAfter months of absence, he finally returned—with another woman by his side.\n**\n“Sign this.” \n\n As soon as Jayden Brennan walks in, he throws a file onto the table in front of me.\n \nI look at the heading. ‘DIVORCE AGREEMENT’. \n \n“No, Jayden, please.\" My hands shake as I beg him. \"You loved me. You just forgot .”\n \nHe looks at me like I’m something he stepped on, his face twisted with disgust.\n\n“Why can’t you just give up? You may have gotten me into bed with you once, but I won’t be slumming anytime soon again. ” \n \nTears pour down my face. Perhaps I should just walk away. God knows I’d tried everything to get him to remember, but all he showed was contempt. \n \n“Ashlyn and I want to engaged. Sign the papers!” he roars. Behind him I notice Ashlyn with a smug look on her face. \n \nThis hits me so hard I want to vomit. I stumble to the kitchen sink and barely manage to hold myself up as I heave, his words echoing in my mind, tearing me apart.\n \nWhen I went back to the dining room, Jayden was looking at me with disgust.\n \n“You can pretend to be sick all you want. I’m not falling for that.\" \n\nHe shoves the pen toward me. The fury on his face almost scares me.\n\n\"If you don’t sign now, I will see that you never have anything.

That is way beneath his level.  \n\nPhillip has been my rock these past three years, helping grow the company. This deal means everything to him, and I’ve agreed to be there for support.\n \nPhillip fidgets, running a hand nervously through his hair. “My palms are sweating,” \n\n“Don’t worry. You got this.” I reassure him.\n \nI haven’t told him about it being a company of my ex. I don’t want him to think he won or lost the contract because of my past.\n \n“Winona, I can’t thank you enough for taking me in as a partner, I can’t believe I’m so close to the start of my dreams!”\n \nHis eyes lit up and he pulled me in close to him. He smells amazing and his fit body envelopes mine.\n \n“Winona, you know how I feel about you. Can I invite you to dinner ?”\n \nI hesitate. “Well...I just want to stay friends and business partners.”\n \nHe looks at me, not giving up. “But you’re attracted to me as well, I can feel it. What’s holding you back? ”\n \nI sigh. He’s right. I am attracted to him. I was just too scared of being hurt again to go there. \n \n“We have to keep it professional. Let’s get this deal signed, then maybe we can talk.”\n \nThen before I can stop him his lips are on mine. His kiss is gentle and the softness of his lips makes me hesitate before pushing him away. \n \n“It’s the wrong timing, Phillip. They’ll be here any second to discuss the deal.”\n \n“I apologize. I’m just so pumped about it and I’ve wanted to kiss you forever.”\n \nI turn around, and standing at our glass door, glaring in at me and Phillip, is Jayden Brennan himself.

Short, consistent sessions are often more effective than long, infrequent ones. \n\nWith Gemiini, parents can seamlessly integrate therapy into daily routines through customizable, engaging lessons accessible anytime, anywhere. Even a few minutes a day can make a significant impact, helping children reach their full potential. Gemiini is a proven tool to boost language development for children with and without special needs, including autism, down syndrome, and speech delays. Studies show that Gemiini can increase language skills by 10 to 30 times faster! Early detection is key to supporting children with autism. Here are 10 common signs to watch for in young children. Gemiini is an on-demand therapy program designed to help individuals with and without special needs improve communication, language, and social skills. It uses evidence-based techniques, such as video modeling, to teach essential skills effectively and efficiently. Gemiini is widely used to support children and adults with autism, down syndrome, speech delays, and other developmental challenges. Jupiter’s Retrograde Wrap-Up: What Have We Learned?\n\nFor the past 100 days, Jupiter—the planet of abundance, growth, and wisdom—has been in retrograde, asking us to pause and reflect inward. In curious Gemini, this wasn’t about chasing opportunities but exploring the deeper truths within ourselves.\n\n💡 What have you discovered?\n\nHave you gained clarity on what truly excites your mind and spirit?\n\nHave you realized where you’ve been spreading yourself too thin?\n\nOr perhaps, you’ve found the courage to rewrite your story?\n\n🌟 The Mantra: Growth begins from the inside. What you nurture within will soon manifest outward.\n\nAs Jupiter prepares to move direct, this is your invitation to take what you’ve learned and align it with intentional action. The seeds you’ve planted will soon grow—so make sure they reflect your truest desires.\n\n🌠 What’s been your biggest lesson during this retrograde?

I don’t want him to think he won or lost the contract because of my past.\n \n“Winona, I can’t thank you enough for taking me in as a partner, I can’t believe I’m so close to the start of my dreams!”\n \nHis eyes lit up and he pulled me in close to him. He smells amazing and his fit body envelopes mine.\n \n“Winona, you know how I feel about you. Can I invite you to dinner ?”\n \nI hesitate. “Well...I just want to stay friends and business partners.”\n \nHe looks at me, not giving up. “But you’re attracted to me as well, I can feel it. What’s holding you back? ”\n \nI sigh. He’s right. I am attracted to him. I was just too scared of being hurt again to go there. \n \n“We have to keep it professional. Let’s get this deal signed, then maybe we can talk.”\n \nThen before I can stop him his lips are on mine. His kiss is gentle and the softness of his lips makes me hesitate before pushing him away. \n \n“It’s the wrong timing, Phillip. They’ll be here any second to discuss the deal.”\n \n“I apologize. I’m just so pumped about it and I’ve wanted to kiss you forever.”\n \nI turn around, and standing at our glass door, glaring in at me and Phillip, is Jayden Brennan himself. My husband fell in love with another woman after he lost his memory in a car accident.\n \nFor three years, he hadn’t touched me—until two months ago, when we were both drunk...\n \nI thought I’d finally won him back. But the next morning, He angrily accused me of drugging him and stormed out without looking back. \n \nAfter months of absence, he finally returned—with another woman by his side.\n**\n“Sign this.” \n\n As soon as Jayden Brennan walks in, he throws a file onto the table in front of me.\n \nI look at the heading. ‘DIVORCE AGREEMENT’. \n \n“No, Jayden, please.\" My hands shake as I beg him. \"You loved me. You just forgot .”\n \nHe looks at me like I’m something he stepped on, his face twisted with disgust.\n\n“Why can’t you just give up? You may have gotten me into bed with you once, but I won’t be slumming anytime soon again. ” \n \nTears pour down my face. Perhaps I should just walk away. God knows I’d tried everything to get him to remember, but all he showed was contempt. \n \n“Ashlyn and I want to engaged. Sign the papers!” he roars. Behind him I notice Ashlyn with a smug look on her face. \n \nThis hits me so hard I want to vomit. I stumble to the kitchen sink and barely manage to hold myself up as I heave, his words echoing in my mind, tearing me apart.\n \nWhen I went back to the dining room, Jayden was looking at me with disgust.\n \n“You can pretend to be sick all you want. I’m not falling for that.\" \n\nHe shoves the pen toward me. The fury on his face almost scares me.\n\n\"If you don’t sign now, I will see that you never have anything. Find some other man to scheme, I promise I won’t get in your way.”\n \nI grip the divorce papers so tight in my hands that it was creased under my fingers.\n \nHe leans forward and stares at me.  \n \n“I can honestly say one thing.” \n \nHis voice is quiet now and my heart skips a beat in hope. \n \nI take the pen, hoping he has something nice to say as we part.\n \n“I wish I never met you.”  \n \nHeartbroken and hurt, I sign the papers and leave him with “Me too.”\n \n...\n \nTHREE YEARS LATER\n \n \nAfter the divorce, my life finally began to turn around.\n \nI start a little firm and give birth to a beautiful daughter.\n \nYes, I was pregnant when I left Jayden, but I never told him.\n \nKeeping my daughter safe and in a stable home environment is worth the sacrifice of leaving her father behind.\n \nI kiss Abby on the forehead. “Momma’s got to go, sweetie.”\n \nToday I'm accompanying my busniess partner Phillip sign a major contract with a big company.\n \nIt’s a subsidiary of Brennan Industries, but there’s no way Jayden would turn up for a meeting with such a small company like mine. That is way beneath his level.  \n\nPhillip has been my rock these past three years, helping grow the company. This deal means everything to him, and I’ve agreed to be there for support.\n \nPhillip fidgets, running a hand nervously through his hair. “My palms are sweating,” \n\n“Don’t worry.

Find some other man to scheme, I promise I won’t get in your way.”\n \nI grip the divorce papers so tight in my hands that it was creased under my fingers.\n \nHe leans forward and stares at me.  \n \n“I can honestly say one thing.” \n \nHis voice is quiet now and my heart skips a beat in hope. \n \nI take the pen, hoping he has something nice to say as we part.\n \n“I wish I never met you.”  \n \nHeartbroken and hurt, I sign the papers and leave him with “Me too.”\n \n...\n \nTHREE YEARS LATER\n \n \nAfter the divorce, my life finally began to turn around.\n \nI start a little firm and give birth to a beautiful daughter.\n \nYes, I was pregnant when I left Jayden, but I never told him.\n \nKeeping my daughter safe and in a stable home environment is worth the sacrifice of leaving her father behind.\n \nI kiss Abby on the forehead. “Momma’s got to go, sweetie.”\n \nToday I'm accompanying my busniess partner Phillip sign a major contract with a big company.\n \nIt’s a subsidiary of Brennan Industries, but there’s no way Jayden would turn up for a meeting with such a small company like mine. That is way beneath his level.  \n\nPhillip has been my rock these past three years, helping grow the company. This deal means everything to him, and I’ve agreed to be there for support.\n \nPhillip fidgets, running a hand nervously through his hair. “My palms are sweating,” \n\n“Don’t worry. You got this.” I reassure him.\n \nI haven’t told him about it being a company of my ex. I don’t want him to think he won or lost the contract because of my past.\n \n“Winona, I can’t thank you enough for taking me in as a partner, I can’t believe I’m so close to the start of my dreams!”\n \nHis eyes lit up and he pulled me in close to him. He smells amazing and his fit body envelopes mine.\n \n“Winona, you know how I feel about you. Can I invite you to dinner ?”\n \nI hesitate. “Well...I just want to stay friends and business partners.”\n \nHe looks at me, not giving up. “But you’re attracted to me as well, I can feel it. What’s holding you back? ”\n \nI sigh. He’s right. I am attracted to him. I was just too scared of being hurt again to go there. \n \n“We have to keep it professional. Let’s get this deal signed, then maybe we can talk.”\n \nThen before I can stop him his lips are on mine. His kiss is gentle and the softness of his lips makes me hesitate before pushing him away. \n \n“It’s the wrong timing, Phillip. They’ll be here any second to discuss the deal.”\n \n“I apologize. I’m just so pumped about it and I’ve wanted to kiss you forever.”\n \nI turn around, and standing at our glass door, glaring in at me and Phillip, is Jayden Brennan himself. My husband fell in love with another woman after he lost his memory in a car accident.\n \nFor three years, he hadn’t touched me—until two months ago, when we were both drunk...\n \nI thought I’d finally won him back. But the next morning, He angrily accused me of drugging him and stormed out without looking back. \n \nAfter months of absence, he finally returned—with another woman by his side.\n**\n“Sign this.” \n\n As soon as Jayden Brennan walks in, he throws a file onto the table in front of me.\n \nI look at the heading. ‘DIVORCE AGREEMENT’. \n \n“No, Jayden, please.\" My hands shake as I beg him. \"You loved me. You just forgot .”\n \nHe looks at me like I’m something he stepped on, his face twisted with disgust.\n\n“Why can’t you just give up? You may have gotten me into bed with you once, but I won’t be slumming anytime soon again. ” \n \nTears pour down my face. Perhaps I should just walk away. God knows I’d tried everything to get him to remember, but all he showed was contempt. \n \n“Ashlyn and I want to engaged. Sign the papers!” he roars. Behind him I notice Ashlyn with a smug look on her face. \n \nThis hits me so hard I want to vomit. I stumble to the kitchen sink and barely manage to hold myself up as I heave, his words echoing in my mind, tearing me apart.\n \nWhen I went back to the dining room, Jayden was looking at me with disgust.\n \n“You can pretend to be sick all you want.

My husband fell in love with another woman after he lost his memory in a car accident.\n \nFor three years, he hadn’t touched me—until two months ago, when we were both drunk...\n \nI thought I’d finally won him back. But the next morning, He angrily accused me of drugging him and stormed out without looking back. \n \nAfter months of absence, he finally returned—with another woman by his side.\n**\n“Sign this.” \n\n As soon as Jayden Brennan walks in, he throws a file onto the table in front of me.\n \nI look at the heading. ‘DIVORCE AGREEMENT’. \n \n“No, Jayden, please.\" My hands shake as I beg him. \"You loved me. You just forgot .”\n \nHe looks at me like I’m something he stepped on, his face twisted with disgust.\n\n“Why can’t you just give up? You may have gotten me into bed with you once, but I won’t be slumming anytime soon again. ” \n \nTears pour down my face. Perhaps I should just walk away. God knows I’d tried everything to get him to remember, but all he showed was contempt. \n \n“Ashlyn and I want to engaged. Sign the papers!” he roars. Behind him I notice Ashlyn with a smug look on her face. \n \nThis hits me so hard I want to vomit. I stumble to the kitchen sink and barely manage to hold myself up as I heave, his words echoing in my mind, tearing me apart.\n \nWhen I went back to the dining room, Jayden was looking at me with disgust.\n \n“You can pretend to be sick all you want. I’m not falling for that.\" \n\nHe shoves the pen toward me. The fury on his face almost scares me.\n\n\"If you don’t sign now, I will see that you never have anything. Find some other man to scheme, I promise I won’t get in your way.”\n \nI grip the divorce papers so tight in my hands that it was creased under my fingers.\n \nHe leans forward and stares at me.  \n \n“I can honestly say one thing.” \n \nHis voice is quiet now and my heart skips a beat in hope. \n \nI take the pen, hoping he has something nice to say as we part.\n \n“I wish I never met you.”  \n \nHeartbroken and hurt, I sign the papers and leave him with “Me too.”\n \n...\n \nTHREE YEARS LATER\n \n \nAfter the divorce, my life finally began to turn around.\n \nI start a little firm and give birth to a beautiful daughter.\n \nYes, I was pregnant when I left Jayden, but I never told him.\n \nKeeping my daughter safe and in a stable home environment is worth the sacrifice of leaving her father behind.\n \nI kiss Abby on the forehead. “Momma’s got to go, sweetie.”\n \nToday I'm accompanying my busniess partner Phillip sign a major contract with a big company.\n \nIt’s a subsidiary of Brennan Industries, but there’s no way Jayden would turn up for a meeting with such a small company like mine. That is way beneath his level.  \n\nPhillip has been my rock these past three years, helping grow the company. This deal means everything to him, and I’ve agreed to be there for support.\n \nPhillip fidgets, running a hand nervously through his hair. “My palms are sweating,” \n\n“Don’t worry. You got this.” I reassure him.\n \nI haven’t told him about it being a company of my ex. I don’t want him to think he won or lost the contract because of my past.\n \n“Winona, I can’t thank you enough for taking me in as a partner, I can’t believe I’m so close to the start of my dreams!”\n \nHis eyes lit up and he pulled me in close to him. He smells amazing and his fit body envelopes mine.\n \n“Winona, you know how I feel about you. Can I invite you to dinner ?”\n \nI hesitate. “Well...I just want to stay friends and business partners.”\n \nHe looks at me, not giving up. “But you’re attracted to me as well, I can feel it. What’s holding you back? ”\n \nI sigh. He’s right. I am attracted to him. I was just too scared of being hurt again to go there. \n \n“We have to keep it professional. Let’s get this deal signed, then maybe we can talk.”\n \nThen before I can stop him his lips are on mine. His kiss is gentle and the softness of his lips makes me hesitate before pushing him away. \n \n“It’s the wrong timing, Phillip. They’ll be here any second to discuss the deal.”\n \n“I apologize.
